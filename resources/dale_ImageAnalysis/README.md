# ImageJ_Course_ICH
Dale's 2 day imagej course slides and exercises
* Excercises are a mix of demos (I do the excercise, they watch), or users hands on. I adapt depending on the class and how fast we are progressing.
* Morning session = part1
* Afternoon session = part 2, often start part 3
* Second morning = part 3 up to macros.
* Second afternoon macros and user macro excercises.
